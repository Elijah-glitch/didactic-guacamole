# Tor Hidden Service

This template allows you to get started developing a Tor (.onion) service on Replit!
First install the [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) Browser to view onion sites.
Then hit the run button to get started! You'll be given a url to visit in the Tor
Browser which you can use to view your website!

This template implements a Node.js server but you can swap it out with whatever you
want, just update the `server` function in `run.sh`!
